# transfer_learning_project
  The project utilizes concepts such as the gram_matrix and uses colab's built-in free gpu for faster processing
The purpose of the project is to extract the features from some style image and extract onto a target image. As a result the target image will be stylistically similar to the style image. 

Project utilizes pytorch and colab 


Project is given credit to rslim's pytorch course on udemy for help with the gram matrix and cnn construction
